Module 3 Reading Questions

On your blog, reflect on any data cleaning you've had to do in other classes.
* Why don't historians discuss this kind of work?
* What gets hidden, what gets lost, how is the ultimate argument weaker as a result?
* Or does it matter? Make reference (or link to) key annotations, whether by you or one of your peers, to support your points.


I realized when I met with Professor Graham that I have used the Voyant Tools Website before in a digital humanities course. I remember we learned about books, the physicality of the book as an object and as data on the internet. I learned that all books are peer reviewed, and judged by a panel of people to see if its information is valid. There are two types, peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed. It’s a new era of digital publication. In one of the articles we read for this week, I found some interesting information on digitized newspapers that reminded me of the digitized texts we analyzed in my digital humanities course, especially through applications like Voyant Tools. In my previous experience with using Voyant, I remember learning about statistics, getting numbers to generate data. For example, in Voyant we can learn how many times a certain word is used and from that why the author chose to use a particular group of vocabulary or a certain word. We plugged in Othello by William Shakespeare into Voyant and we analyzed the data in class. 

In the article that I previously mentioned, (Mining and Mapping the Production of Space by Cameron Blevins) I found the part about digitized newspapers interesting. Blevins explains that they are messy sources and if historians insist on perfect data, they risk ignoring huge swathes of the digital archive. Blevins writes, “One goal of my project was to find a way to draw meaning from messy text”. I think this is exactly what we are doing when we use Voyant. Any sort of data is usable and there is always meaning in the data. Cleaning, organizing, finding and analyzing is what digital historians do best.

I remember reading a hypertext version of Shakespeare’s Sonnet 138. The text I had read had been modernized and regularized, meaning digital historians have essentially rebuilt the original text into a formalized, explicit version. They build hypertextually from folio and quarto versions of texts. A peer annotated in the same Mining and Mapping the Production of Space article, and I found her comments interesting in response a section of the article reading, “I weave together both digital and traditional readings of the text to present a richer understanding of how newspapers produced space.” The peer, xvictoriajordan, wrote “every week I realize more and more how this connecting of the two is important and what it can do for historians. I absolutely agree. Sometimes historians ignore data because they don’t think it will be of any use to their work or data mining, however there is always relevant information in past work and present that can be resourceful.
